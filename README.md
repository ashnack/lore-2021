# Lore 2021

## Installation

### Local installation
Install python (3.6 and above would do fine, 3.9 is best), making sure python is in the path and that pip is enabled 
 
### Docker installation
 1. Install docker desktop (might take a little more system ressources than local mode) and run it.
 2. Run create_user.bat to... wait for it... create an admin account
 
## Running the application
Select the run_{XXX}.bat that corresponds to your installation type and leave it open if in local mode.
Then, in a browser, go to http://localhost:2021 and login.

To add your ods file, there is a trombone icon in the donations page.

## Simple spreadsheet conversion
In the install directory, put your spreadsheet files in the files subfolder and run run_files.bat
